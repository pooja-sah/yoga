<h1 align="center">3 COMMON MISTAKES IN WHEN START YOGA  </h1>
</b>
<p class="cajao">Many people start yoga without having basic knowledge necessary to achieve their goals..........................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>After a few weeks they get discourage because they see no desired results and as a consequence of that ,they end up giving it up.....</p>
<p class="caja">In this article I present the <b>5 most common mistakes when training</b> that people who are starting in this world usually make.........................</p>
        
        <p>This topic has probably been very repetitive for many, but I will tell you the 5 points that, according to my experience, have been the most fundamental and those that I usually see in most people.</p>
        
       <p>*Starting the list we have:</p>
       <ol>
       	<li id="TP">Too much focus on the shape of the pose</li>
       	<li id="N">Forgetting about your breath</li>
       	<li id="AOG">Pushing yourself too much, too quickly</li>
       </ol>
       <p>Once listed, Let's explain them</p>
       <br>
       <h2 align="center" class="titulo">1.Too much focus on the shape of the pose</h2>
       <img class="entreno" src="index1.jpg" border="3px" height="200px" width="280px" alt=""/>
       <p class="cajaF">Just because you cannot get into the full expression of the pose, or practise the pose like your neighbour or teacher does, doesn't mean that the steps you take to approach the full expression aren't worth it! There is no such thing as a "perfect" pose. There is however a "perfect pose" for you. Every pose can be broken down, so if you have difficulty, ask the teacher for a variation. Pay attention yourself to the shape and actions of the pose: is it a backbend, forward bend? Where are the arms in relation to the shoulder and the legs in relation to the hips? Copy those basics elements and do something similar that your body can handle and that feels good! It's about enjoying the stretch, where ever and when ever you feel it, making your body a bit more flexible over time</p>
       <p class="cajaG">Some of these muscles move your torso by flexing, extending, or rotating your spine. Others stabilize your pelvis and spine in a natural, neutral position. Old-style sit-ups used only a few of these muscles, often with jerky momentum. Today's yoga, Pilates, and core fitness programs target your entire core with slow, controlled movements to get the most out of your workout.
       	<p>Make these posture-boosting exercises a regular part of your routine. Remember to exhale strongly and pull in your core muscles as you work -- a key principle in both Pilates and yoga.Please make sure you’re fully warmed up before trying out any individual poses. Work with patience and stability and stay focused on the practice rather than the final shape of any particular pose. As Sandra Carson says in her brilliant article The Flexibility Myth,“We can get so fixated on getting somewhere, becoming something, that we bypass ourselves and unconsciously put our health at risk”.</p>
       	<h2 align="center" class="titulo1">2.Forgetting about your breath</h2>
       	<img class="entreno1" src="index2.jpg" border="3px" width="280px" height="200px" alt=""/>
       	<p class="cajaD">Awareness of the breath keeps you safe. Observe how your breath reacts to your movements. If your breathing strains you are pushing yourself to far. As long as you can practise the poses with a natural easy breath, chances you are overdoing it are small!

Focusing on the breath in yoga has many benefits. It keeps the mind alert and present, since the breath is always happening "now". When breath and movement synchronize the magic in yoga begins. The mind becomes quiet and we experience peace.</p>
</p>
<p>
The first breathing skill is called Natural Breathing, or abdominal breathing. In fact, this is a good way to breathe all day long, unless you are involved in physical activity. In other words, you should practice breathing this way all day long, since it provides for sufficient oxygen intake and controls the exhalation of carbon dioxide.

It's very simple and it goes like this:

Gently and slowly inhale a normal amount of air through your nose, filling your lower lungs. Then exhale easily. You might first try it with one hand on your stomach and one on your chest. As you inhale gently, your lower hand should rise while your upper hand stays still. Continue this gentle breathing pattern with a relaxed attitude, concentrating on filling only the lower lungs.Practice this Calming Breath at least ten times a day for several weeks. Use it during times of transition, between projects or whenever you want to let go of tension and begin to experience a sense of calmness. This will help you become familiar and comfortable with the process. And use it any time you begin to feel anxiety or panic building. When you need a tool to help you calm down during panic, you will be more familiar and comfortable with the process.

The third technique is called Calming Counts. It has two benefits over Calming Breath. First, it takes longer to complete: about 90 seconds instead of 30 seconds. You will be spending that time concentrating on a specific task instead of paying so much attention to your worried thoughts. If you can let time pass without such intense focus on your fearful thoughts, you will have a better chance at controlling those thoughts. Second, Calming Counts, like Natural Breathing and the Calming Breath, help access the Calming Response. That means you will be giving yourself 90 seconds to cool your body out and quiet your thoughts. Then, after that time has passed, you will less anxious than you were.</p>

	<p>It is natural to want to progress when you start practising yoga. So when you find a boundary by all means gently lean into it, but don't push it… When you push your body a little too much you can scare it and your body will react by protecting itself and that boundary. Basically this means it will tighten up more and as a result, that boundary is a bit further out of reach the next time. You are likely to become less flexible and more tight. This is of course unpleasant.

Another scenario is if you push beyond your boundary you can run the risk of injuring yourself. If you push on a regular basis, after a few years an injury can arise and it won't be so easy to heal.

When you master the art of playing your edge, your body will quite happily open up more, your body adapts slowly to what you ask of it. So if you give it time and ask kindly and it will respond!
Warming up means introducing the body gently to what you want from it. You can warm up different ways. You can warm up through specific warming up exercises, bringing heat to the body through increased circulation. You should always warm up by doing the more simple poses first and slowly building to the more advanced pose. This reduces the chance of over stretching because the body is prepared.
In the cool down portion of a class you take the opportunity to balance what you have done. This is done through counter poses, softening what you have tried to strengthen, bringing stability back to an area you have loosened, etc..
